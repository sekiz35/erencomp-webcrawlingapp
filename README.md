Erencomp. A web crawling app with react to make buying a computer easier.


# 1. Why?

Choosing a new computer is a big decision, to decide selecting and buying one is a burdensome thing to do. If only there was a website that could save people from the grueling process by collecting products from various websites and presenting them to the user at the same time. With our website CompEren, we aim to solve this problem, so you can enter your desired features and we will gather data from all across the web for you to select the seller you wish to buy your computer from.

# 2. What?

Because the process of buying a computer can be very overwhelming, when there are too many factors to consider in your purchase, with CompEren, our objective is to simplify the process for you. 
Our website will allow you lovely people to add all the desired features you might need to know about such as, graphics card type, ram type, processor, screen inches, brand, memory and all the other things you might need to know before buying. This way it will be okay if you don’t have yet decided what you need with every aspect of your dream computer. With the filters you set, we will be presenting to you all the reviews, comments, satisfaction scores of the products that fit the constraints. You can just sit back and enjoy the ride.

# 3. How?

Technologies we want to use:

  -	For client side – JavaScript (React.js)
  -	FireBase for database management
  -	Flask Framework of Python for server-side
  -	Selenium or Beautiful Soup of Python for crawling and scraping the websites.

In the first step, we plan to scrape data from the two most popular e-shopping platforms, Trendyol and Hepsiburada. Then we are going to structure the data we have gathered so far, just to make it easier to process on. Eventually, these well-structured data will easily be handled and presented to the user on developed interface.

# 4. When?

Here is an approximate time table:

  Front-end: should take about a week
  Back - end: should also take about a week 
  Scraping data: should take up to 1 or 2 weeks
  
So with considering any possible case, the project should take from 3 to 4 weeks in total.
